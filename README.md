## Modelling-Planetary-Climate
Evaluates key planetary climate variables (eg. OLR, radiative surface temperatures, optical depth profiles) using a series of 1d and 0d modelling techniques. This project aims to explore methods of modelling large-scale Earth system and interpreting the results through the lens of spectroscopy, radiative transfer and thermodynamics. Most problems tackled in this repository have been suggested by @JoyMonteiro.
