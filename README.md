## Modelling-Planetary-Climate
Evaluates key planetary climate variables (eg. OLR, radiative surface temperatures, optical depth profiles) using a series of 1d and 0d modelling techniques. This project aims to explore methods of modelling large-scale Earth system and interpreting the results through the lens of spectroscopy, radiative transfer and thermodynamics. All problems \in this repository have been completed under the guidance of [Dr. Joy Merwin Monteiro]{https://joymonteiro.github.io} (IISER-Pune), using his EC2213 lectures.

A report (entitled, "Modelling Planetary Climate") documenting our results is currently being created, and will be uploaded to the root directory of the repository upon completion.
